# Attacking-an-Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-


Inspired from the human brain, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a type of computer vision model to classify images into certain categories. We we will consider ANNs for the task of recognising handwritten digits (0 to 9) from black-and-white images with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. For this project I have created functions that compute an ANN output for a given input, and then expanded to create functions to “attack” an ANN. That is, to try to generate inputs that will fool the network to make a wrong classification.
